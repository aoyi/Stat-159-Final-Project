## Data README

This data folder contains three sub-folders: data-sets, data-outputs and regression-data.

The data-sets folder contains three sub-folders: `cleaned-data-set`, `original-data-set`, and `train-test-data-set`. 

   `cleaned-data-set` contains four csv files: 

       `categorized-data.csv` is the clean data divided into 8 clusters generated by ``.
       `clean-data.csv` is the clean data generated by `data-cleaning.R`.
       `overall-test-set.csv` is the test set of clean data generated by ``.
       `overall-train-set.csv` is the train set of clean data generated by ``.
   
   `original-data-set` contains two csv files:

       `major-cities.csv` contains the data for the major cities and it is generated by ``. 
       `state.csv` divides the states into 4 regions and it is generated by ``.
	
   `train-set.csv` and `test-set.csv` are also generated by `clean-data.R`. `train-set.csv` contains a random sample of size 300 from `scaled-credit.csv` and `test-set.csv` contains the rest of 100 observations that are not included in the train set.

The eda-outputs folder contains four text files: `eda-output-anova.txt`, `eda-output-correlation.txt`, `eda-output-qualitaive.txt`, and `eda-output-quantitative.txt`. All of the four text files are generated by `eda-script.R`.

   `eda-output-qualitative.txt` contains the summary statistics for all the qualitative variables.

   `eda-output-quantitative.txt` contains the summary statistics for all the quantitative variables.
	
   `eda-output-correlation.txt` contains matrix of correlations among all quantitative variables.

   `eda-output-anova.txt` contains summary of anova between balance and all the qualitative variables.

The regression-data folder contains
